## Sort arrays with and without in-built functions
Problem Statement
We are given an array of numbers and we need to arrange them in ascending order i.e., a smaller number followed by a higher number.

Sample Examples
Example

Input

Array [0,3,5,2,4,1]

Output
Array [0,1,2,3,4,5]

 
Explanation: The sorted array in the ascending order would be: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

We will use the built in function sort().
# sort.js
### Aproach
1.- Declare the array. <br/>
2.- Call the array.sort() function. <br/>
3.- Print the result to the console. <br/>
